## One line bio

Developer, mostly focused on JavaScript. CTO @ Cloud Horizon and JS Belgrade meetup organizer. Loves open source.

## Bio

I am Slobodan Stojanović, programmer and entrepreneur from Belgrade, Serbia.

For past 5 years I work as a CTO and a partner at Cloud Horizon, small Canadian-Serbian company that builds a web apps for a lot of interesting startups mostly from North America (ie. we are building some cool offline web apps to allow one of our clients to track bad bugs at their rooftop greenhouses and release some good bugs to eat them, because they don't use pesticides).
I am also one of the organizers of JS Belgrade meetups.

I love JavaScript and open source, and I love to play with offline webapps, chatbots, serverless architectures and new things available in both browser and NodeJS.

I spoke at:
- WebCamp Ljubljana 2016 - "Offline webapps"
- Full Stack Fest Barcelona 2016 - "How to build a website that will (eventually) work on Mars"
- WebCamp Zagreb 2016 - "How to build a website that will (eventually) work on Mars"
- HolyJS Moscow 2016 - "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Serverless Chatbots"
- Voxxed Days Bristol 2017 - "How to build a website that will (eventually) work on Mars"
- Multiple meetups with a few different topics
