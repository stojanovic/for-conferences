# Offline Web Apps

## Abstract

This talk will cover 3 important parts of offline web apps - service workers, app cache and client-side storage. Service workers are cool new event-driven workers that enables our web apps to fully work offline, including intercepting and modifying requests, handle caching etc. Unfortunately it still doesnâ€™t work in all browsers, so we still need App cache in some cases - older and not so great solution for offline caching but it works in all major browsers. For fully-functional web apps we need to have some kind of a client-side storage, last part of the talk will review Indexed DB, Web SQL and of course localStorage.
